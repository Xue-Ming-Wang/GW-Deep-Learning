# GW Deep Learning

The course, Statistical Deep Learning, introduces deep neural networks, covering architectures (CNN, RNN, GANs), algorithms (backpropagation, gradient descent), and applications (image classification, NLP). Using Python, I gain hands-on experience building models and can analyze data with deep learning, apply methods to real-world problems, and interpret complex models.

# Project 1 - Land Use Classification with CNN

Long Description (100–150 words): This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for automated land use classification from aerial imagery, achieving 73.96% accuracy on the UCMerced_LandUse dataset. The dataset includes 2,100 images across 21 land use categories, such as agricultural areas, urban structures, and natural landscapes. Key steps involved preprocessing (resizing to 224x224 pixels, normalization), model architecture design (3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation, dropout for regularization), and training with data augmentation to enhance generalization. The model's performance demonstrates its potential for real-world applications in urban planning, resource management, and environmental monitoring. Future improvements could involve expanding the dataset, refining the model complexity, and analyzing misclassifications via confusion matrices. This work highlights the value of deep learning in geospatial analysis for sustainable development and land use optimization.

# Project 2 - Healthcare Chatbot with Deep Learning

This project explores the development of an AI-driven healthcare chatbot designed to improve communication between patients and healthcare providers. Leveraging deep learning techniques such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and word embedding, the chatbot aims to deliver accurate, personalized medical assistance in real-time. The research utilizes a dataset from Hugging Face containing over 100,000 patient-chatbot interactions to train and validate the model. Key stages include text preprocessing, tokenization, and sequence padding to optimize performance. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.88 on both training and validation sets, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities. Challenges such as dataset biases and real-world applicability are acknowledged, with future directions including advanced NLP techniques like transformer models and real-time learning integration. This work highlights the potential of AI chatbots to revolutionize healthcare accessibility and patient care by providing immediate, reliable medical guidance.
